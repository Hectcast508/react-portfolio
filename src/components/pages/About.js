        Full stack web developer continuously learning new technologies and skills to improve in my professional career as well in my personal projects. What motivated me to be a web developer was knowing all the amazing projects my friends would show me and that inspired me to take the first steps. I seek to be a developer that designs intuitive applications. Attended UCR Bootcamp Extension where I recently earned a certificate in full stack development with new skills developed in JavaScript, Express , MongoDB, React.js, Node, and responsive web design. Throughout every project I look for issues that I can improve and find ways to code more efficiently. I worked on a team of four to develop a single-page MERN app that assists high school students and faculty with being able to schedule appointments for specific subjects. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences on the web.
